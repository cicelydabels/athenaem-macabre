        <h1>Lenore</h1>
        <h2>Edgar Allan Poe</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
  

        <p>
            Ah, broken is the golden bowl!&#8212;the spirit flown forever!<br>
            Let the bell toll!&#8212;a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river:&#8212;<br>
            And, Guy De Vere, hast thou no tear?&#8212;weep now or never more!<br>
            See! on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love, Lenore!<br>
            Come, let the burial rite be read&#8212;the funeral song be sung!&#8212;<br>
            An anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young&#8212;<br>
            A dirge for her the doubly dead in that she died so young.<br><br>
            <q>Wretches! ye loved her for her wealth and ye hated her for her pride;<br>
            And, when she fell in feeble health, ye blessed her&#8212;that she died:&#8212;<br>
            How shall the ritual, then, be read?&#8212;the requiem how be sung<br>
            By you&#8212;by yours, the evil eye&#8212;by yours the slanderous tongue<br>
            That did to death the innocence that died and died so young?</q><br><br>
            Peccavimus; yet rave not thus! but let a Sabbath song<br>
            Go up to God so solemnly the dead may feel no wrong!<br>
            The sweet Lenore <q>hath gone before,</q> with Hope that flew beside,<br>
            Leaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy bride&#8212;<br>
            For her, the fair and debonair, that now so lowly lies,<br>
            The life upon her yellow hair, but not within her eyes&#8212;<br>
            The life still there upon her hair&#8212;the death upon her eyes.<br><br>
            <q>Avaunt!&#8212;avaunt! from fiends below the indignant ghost is riven&#8212;<br>
            From Hell unto a high estate far up within the Heaven&#8212;<br>
            From grief and groan to a golden throne beside the King of Heaven!&#8212;<br>
            Let no bell toll, then!&#8212;lest her soul, amid its hallowed mirth,<br>
            Should catch the note as it doth float up from the damned Earth!<br>
            And I&#8212;to-night my heart is light!&#8212;no dirge will I upraise,<br>
            But waft the angel on her flight with a Paean of old days!</q>
